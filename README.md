# Data_analyst_task3

This project involves comprehensive SQL-based analysis on a fictional *Sales* database. The goal was to extract business insights, improve data accessibility, and optimize query performance. Below are the key tasks performed:

 1. Data Analysis & Filtering
- Queried *total profit by country*, sorted in descending order.
- Filtered *sales for January 2019* using WHERE clause.
- Grouped data using GROUP BY for monthly and product-based summaries.

2. Data Normalization & Joins
- Created separate *Countries* and *Products* tables to normalize data.
- Used *INNER JOIN, **LEFT JOIN, and **RIGHT JOIN* to merge data for enriched insights.

 3. Subqueries
- Identified countries with *above-average profit* using subqueries.

 4. Aggregate Functions
- Calculated *average profit per product*.
- Summarized *monthly revenue and cost*.

 5. Views for Reporting
- Created a Monthly_Summary view to simplify future monthly analysis.

 6. Query Optimization
- Added indexes on Country and Product columns for faster filtering and joining.
